          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hello! I’m a passionate and curious web developer currently exploring the world of modern frontend development.
          I love building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces — and I enjoy learning new technologies as I go.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I’m always up for a challenge and love solving real-world problems through code.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This portfolio is a work in progress — just like me! I'm actively seeking internships or projects where I can grow, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully as a developer.
        </p>
